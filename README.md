# Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting

## AIM:
To write a program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Import the values.
3. Display the program.
4. End the program.

## Program:
~~~
Program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix.

import numpy as np


import sys

n = int(input())

a = np.zeros((n,n+1))

X = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(n+1):

        a[i][j] = float(input())

for i in range(n):

    if a[i][i] == 0.0:

        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected')

    for j in range(i+1, n):


        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]

        for k in range(n+1):

            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]

X[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]

for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):

    X[i] = a[i][n]

    for j in range(i+1,n):

        X[i] = X[i] - a[i][j]*X[j]

    X[i] = X[i]/a[i][i]

for i in range(n):

    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,X[i]), end = ' ')
